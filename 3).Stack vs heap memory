in c++,no of bytes taken depends on the compiler
when we declare the elements in the memory,the memory is associated with stack
how many bytes of memory is required is decided by the compile time so it is static memory allocation
Heap is a term used for unorganised memory
stack memory is organized(how the activation memory is made and destroyed)
heap memory is considered as a resource(when u require the memory u take and when u dont require u can release the memory)
programme cannot directly access heap memory.it can access anything inside heap memory and it can access anything inside code
but programme can access heap memory using pointer
new means memory is allocated in heap
program cant access directly heap so using pointer it can access heap.
in c++ we use p=new Int[5];
in c we use p=(int *)malloc(2*5);
for deleting of array we use 
delete []b
