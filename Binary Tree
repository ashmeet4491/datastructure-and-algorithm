//trees is  used to represent heirarchichal form of data.
//it is a non linear data structure
//it can contain data as well as it can contain link to some other nodes
//a Binary tree contains Parent,Root,children and leaf node.
//leaf node has no children.
//we can go from up to down but not from down to up.
//the root trees is a recursive data structure.
//trees with n nodes 
//the edes are n-1
//depth of the node in  a tree is a connection from root to th tree.
//height of tree is no of longest path from node to leaf .
//binary tree should have atmost 2 children.
//a strict binary tree can have 0 or more children
//complete binary tree -all node except the last level are completely filled and the left as possible.
//maximum no of node at any level is 2 to the power level 
//perfect binary tree if all the level are filled.
//max no of nodes with height h is 2
