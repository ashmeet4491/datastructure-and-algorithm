static variables is not created inside  the stack section .instead it is created inside the code section
if it is inside the function it is not created everytime instead it is just creted one time when the program gets loadedt
n is having multiple copies in th stack 
but the static varial is not having any copies


int fun(int n)
{
 static int x=0;
 if(n>0)
 {
 x++;
 return fun(n-1)+x;
 }
 return 0;
}
int main() {
 int r;
 r=fun(5);
 printf("%d\n",r);

 r=fun(5);
 printf("%d\n",r);

 return 0;
}
