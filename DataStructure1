A data structure is a way to organise and set set data in such a way that it can be used efficiently.
Abstract data types-
List-Collection of object of same data types.
1).Store a no of object of same data types in a list
2).read/modify
an array is created (if somehow the array got filled we will not be able to store the elements in an array).in this case ,we will have to 
create the array and copy the elements from the previous array.and then add the elments.
 it is very costly.
so when the array is full we will have to create the array of double the size .
read write element from array will be O(1).
inserting an element will be O(n).
removing an element will be O(n).//n is the size of array.
add-O(n).
