physical data structures
a).Array
b).linked list
Logical data structures
a).stack
b).queues
c).trees
d).graph
f).hash table
physical data structure actually holds the data in the memory
stacks and queues are linear data structures
trees graph and hash table are non linear data structures
Hah table may be linear or tabular data sturucture
Stacks works in LIFO 
and queues works in FIFO
the logical data structures are implemented using phusical data structure
