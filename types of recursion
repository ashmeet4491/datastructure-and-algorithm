there are 5 types of recursion
a).tail recursion
b).head recursion
c).tree recursion
d).Indirect recursion
e).nested recursion
tail recursion is that recursion in which the last statement is the calling statement itself then it is the tail recursion
in tail recursion the addition is performed at return time
tail recursion means it doesn't have to perform any operation  just have to written one calling statement

head recursion means that that the calling statement will be the first staement
tree recursion is that recursion in which the function is calling itself more than one time
the order of tree recursion is O(2)
Space complexity-the space occupiesd in the stack
Indirect recurion is that recursion in which the function is calling a functions in cycle
suppose A is calling B and B is calling C and then C is calling A again then that function becomes a cycle and then that functio is called 
indirect recursion
Nested recursion is recursion inside Recursion
